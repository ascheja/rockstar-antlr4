A ANTLR4 grammar for the Rockstar Programming Language
======================================================
This is a [ANTLR4](https://www.antlr.org) grammar for the
[rockstar programming language](https://github.com/dylanbeattie/rockstar).
There are probably a dozen ways of doing it better (or simpler) than I did, but as this is my first
ANTLR grammar.

Known problems
--------------
I'm sure there are lots of them :-)

Stuff I hope to get added
-------------------------
Mostly automated tests, created the grammar with help of the ANTLR plugin for IntelliJ, but checking everything
by hand for every change doesn't work too well.
